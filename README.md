# Demo files for a new website #

This is my little working document where I'm sandboxing a new website that actually uses CSS.

## To do: ##

1. Find code for a guestbook (actually probably low priority)
2. Filter content into relevant sub-pages
3. Find good embedded players (bandcamp, youtube?)
4. Host dissertation on-site?  

--------------------

4. Update with new compositions from concert (scores/audio)
